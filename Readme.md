# ShoppingCart | Javascript OOP



## Description
This project demonstrates how to implement a shopping cart feature using JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This cart feature allows users to add products to the cart, manage the quantity of products, display the cart contents, and calculate the total price of the products in the cart.


### Purpose
The shopping cart feature is essential for e-commerce websites. With this feature, users can:
- Easily add products to the cart.
- Manage the quantity of products in the cart.
- View the total price of all products in the cart.
- Remove products from the cart if they are not wanted.




## Code Explanation

### JavaScript (ShoppingCart.js)

The JavaScript file contains the `ShoppingCart` class, which:

- Initializes the cart and cart element.
- Adds an event listener for adding and removing products.
- Validates the product quantity.
- Displays or hides cart contents and total price based on the cart status.




## Advantages of the Cart Feature Written in JavaScript OOP

1. **Modularity**: Using OOP makes the code more modular. Each part of the shopping cart, such as adding products, removing products, and calculating the total, is implemented as a method within the `ShoppingCart` class. This modularity makes the code easier to manage and extend.

2. **Reusability**: The `ShoppingCart` class can be reused across different parts of the application or even in other projects without needing to rewrite its functionality. This saves time and effort in development.

3. **Encapsulation**: OOP allows for encapsulation of data and methods. This means that the internal data of the class (like the list of products in the cart) cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. This reduces the risk of accidental data modification and enhances security.

4. **Maintainability**: Code written with an OOP approach is easier to maintain. With a clear and organized structure, other developers working with this code can understand and modify it more easily.

5. **Extendability**: OOP makes it easier to extend the functionality of the shopping cart. For example, new features such as discount calculation or different types of promotions can be added by extending the `ShoppingCart` class.

6. **Scalability**: As the project grows, the OOP approach ensures that the shopping cart feature can scale efficiently. New product types, pricing rules, and other functionalities can be integrated without major changes to the existing codebase.

Overall, writing the shopping cart feature using JavaScript OOP provides a clear structure, making the code easier to manage, extend, and reuse in various contexts.
